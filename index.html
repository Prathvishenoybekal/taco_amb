It was founded in 1972 by Victor Hernandez, a Mexican immigrant who came to the United States with dreams of opening his own restaurant. Victor started out small, selling tacos out of a food truck in the parking lot of a local grocery store. But his tacos were so delicious that word quickly spread, and soon he was able to open a brick-and-mortar shop.</p></li>
     <li><p>&nbsp;Torchy's Taco Shop has always been known for its authentic Mexican cuisine. The tacos are made with fresh, high-quality ingredients, and the recipes are all family secrets. Torchy's also has a wide variety of other Mexican dishes, like burritos, enchiladas, and quesadillas.</p></li>
